# An Example

## Introduction
Imagine a scenario where researchers are trying to determine whether a chemical found in traditional Chinese herbal medicines, Aristolochic Acid (AA), causes kidney cancer. Twenty years ago, this causal relationship was still under investigation. The evidence for this relationship is now spread across a vast research literature.

## EvidenceBench Task Overview
EvidenceBench presents the task of extracting evidence for or against a hypothesis from a specific paper. In this example, the task is to identify evidence from the paper [Hoang et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5533284/).

## Survey Summary & Hypothesis Extraction
The Survey Summary provides a ground-truth description of the relevant evidence. It is extracted from a survey article on Aristolochic Acid, and gives a concise overview of key findings from Hoang et al. (2016). The Hypothesis is the central question the researchers are trying to answer, in this case, whether AA-induced DNA mutations cause kidney cancer.


**Survey Summary**: 
Results from Hoang et al. (2016) showed that a cumulative ingestion of more than 250 mg of AA increased the risk of ccRCC with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.25. A distinctive AA mutational signature was evident in 6/10 sequenced ccRCC exomes from AA-exposed patients. Among these tumors, VHL, the most frequently mutated gene, mutated in 7 out of 10 samples.

**Hypothesis**: 
Aristolochic Acid (AA) induced DNA mutation is causal for renal carcinoma (RCC).

## Study Aspect Decomposition
EvidenceBench breaks the Survey Summary into Study Aspects, and then compares these aspects to each sentence in Hoang et al. (2016), generating per-sentence annotations for the paper. Below, we show the three Study Aspects for Hoang et al. (2016), along with the sentences from the paper that are sources of information for these aspects.

1. **Increased Risk of ccRCC**
   - Cumulative ingestion of more than 250 mg of AA increased the risk of ccRCC (OR, 1.25).
   - Sentences reflecting this aspect:
     - "Cumulative ingestion of more than 250 mg of AA increased risk of ccRCC (OR, 1.25), and we detected dA-AL-I adducts in 76% of Taiwanese ccRCC patients." (Sentence 9)
     - "The results (Table 1) indicate an adjusted OR of 1.25 (1.004â€“1.547) for ccRCC in persons consuming more than 250 mg of AA during the period of 1997 to 2003." (Sentence 69)

2. **AA Mutational Signature**
   - A unique mutation pattern caused by AA was evident in the study.
   - Sentences reflecting this aspect:
     - "Whole-exome sequencing confirmed that the AA mutational signature was present in 6 of 10 ccRCC patients studied." (Sentence 163)

3. **Frequent Mutation of VHL Gene**
   - The VHL gene mutation was a common occurrence in the patients studied.
   - Sentences reflecting this aspect:
     - "VHL was the most frequently mutated driver gene (7/10 tumors) in our AA-exposed ccRCCs (Table 2)." (Sentence 106)

## Sentence Retrieval Task
The EvidenceBench task is to retrieve the sentences in the paper that provide evidence for the hypothesis. Performance is measured based on how many Study Aspects are covered by the retrieved sentences.
